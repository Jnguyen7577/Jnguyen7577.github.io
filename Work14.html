        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The name of this piece is "Perfecttttt" with five t's making the spelling itself not so perfect. Also the image itself is not clear and can be seen as chaotic with all of the colors and glitches. With these factors and imperfections I still label this to be whole; the "flaws" of this piece is what makes this complete.
  <br>
<br>
  "Perfecttttt" is made to be an "image video" or a video that is meant to be looked at as an image. It is made of two images, one that was glitched through Illustator and the other that was glitched through Audacity. I finalized everything with Touchdesigner. For the audio I recorded white noise and muffled it to set the atmosphere of the piece.
