        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my first time using Fusion and a first impression of mine is that it feels like an Illustrator version of Blender or Maya. Sculpting with blender involves more precise measurements and lines which is similar to how one would use Illustrator when creating a logo. Working with Fusion was challenging at first since it is like learning a new language but the more I play around with it the more things start to make sense. The second stamp I created is based on Dio from Jojo which can be seen through the stamp text which says "Za Warudo" and the color scheme.</p>
