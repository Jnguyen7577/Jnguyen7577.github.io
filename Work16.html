        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I requested the dancers to freestyle to any song of their choice while being blindfold so that all they have is the music and their movements. I wanted to capture each dancer in their own world that they created for themselves and then compliment that feeling with visual effects using Premiere Pro. 
  <br>
<br>
  In a way I wanted this to be the dancer's escape from reality, to just live in their own world for a while. Each dancer's escape and how they wish to express themselves is unique to their own character and with this piece I did not want to limit their prefered world.
