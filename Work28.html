        <p>In this short, the figure is seen missing their face to then find it suspended in air. It travels farther as the figure makes an attempt to obtain what is lost.</p>
        <p>The challenge with this animation was animating the figure's gestures and having to portray some kind of struggle without giving it a voice. The animation was then taken to Premiere Pro where I would include royalty free audio that I edited using Audacity.</p>
