        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a projection about how we view the world around us. 
Different people see the world in their own way and in this projection the world is distorted and manipulated. The sound is what snaps us back into reality while we experience the unnatural. 

  <br>
<br>
  I created this projection with the idea of placing someone in a 
different setting from reality using pictures that I took and then manipulating them using TouchDesigner. The audio, which was recorded from outside, will help create the atmosphere making it feel as though they are truly there despite seeing an altered version of reality. 
This is intended to be projected onto the entire wall as well as the floor in a small gallery for people to walk in and be in the moment.
