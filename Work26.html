        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Tatsuo on the Beach" is a side-scroller where you play as Tatsuo as he surfs his way to the finish while jumping waves and dodging obstacles such as pigs and rocks. This project was made by a team of 3, one programmer and two artists.</p>
        <p>I worked on the character design and animation and coordinated with the programmer about the game mechanics and level design.</p>
