        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Not being familiar with After Effects I wanted to challenge myself with a project that relies heavily on the software. So with that in mind I came up with this idea to film and edit my own anime opening. Anime is something that I really enjoy and there are also a lot of effects used in anime so with this video I wanted to throw in visuals that are seen in your typical anime opening.</p>
