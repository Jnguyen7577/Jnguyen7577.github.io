        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Jason Nguyen, currently a digital media art major in the San Jose State University BFA Program. I am currently developing my skills in various fields such as Maya, Unity, Aftereffects, as well as refining my understanding with html, css, and js coding. I am always excited and open to learn more. As of now my works revolve around the exploration of myself and who I am as an individual. I also enjoy putting the audience in  unique experiences through works of art by triggering their emotions through visuals that I create. 
<br>
<br>
Growing up, I have always been fond of video games and anime for the many aspects that they bring from character design to special effects and the emotions that they bring to me. That is what made me want to dive deeper into the world of art and learn more about it. Throughout my life I have always been exposed to various forms of art and it is through those works that keep on inspiring and pushing me to develop my creative thinking. I would explore photography to learn how to use the camera and capture my experiences and attend galleries to gain more inspiration. I have also explored cinematography to execute my ideas as some sort of summer project. What I love about art is the experience it puts people through. It can bring joy or it can get people to think and have discussions with one another. Sometimes it does not have to have meaning and can just simply be of existence. What I find most joy in art is the experience I put people in. It can be done through any medium, it can be experienced through a painting, virtual reality, or even just auditory experiences. Referring back to my love for video games, that is exactly what they do for people. The video games I mostly enjoy playing are the ones that get players to be really immersed in their roles and the world that is being presented to them.
<br>
<br>
Other forms of art I take part in as well as use as an outlet for my creativity is choreographing and teaching dance. One of the things I enjoy about choreographing dance and directing shows is that I get to explore concepts and tell stories using the human body. Once in a while I like to put together a crew and work on video projects whether it be music videos or dance videos to help push my creative vision. With these videos I get to combine the two things I love which is art and dance and explore the many possibilities of bringing both worlds together as well as creating more outlets for my creativity.
<br>
<br>
Currently as an artist I am exploring who I am and putting those ideas into my artwork. The general theme I find myself gravitating most towards is discovering my identity and what I mean to myself while also allowing the viewers go through experiences through my work and possibly learning a bit about themselves. While I am exploring myself I have not forgotten the roots of where my journey began and that is through the emotions and joy that art gave me.
