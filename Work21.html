        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a randomizer I created that will randomly generate your video game persona as well as your hometown. This idea came up as I thought about the fascination of having some sort of avatar or character that resembles you. In some cases people also enjoy being given their roles rather than choosing it for themselves which is the purpose of this randomizer.</p>
