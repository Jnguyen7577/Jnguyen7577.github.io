        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an experience that will take the viewer to three destinations of their choosing. Each destination will feature videos and sounds of places that have been altered. Below the video will be a text box where the viewer can type their thoughts, like a journal. There is no submission button so the viewer is free to write out their thoughts and feelings as some sort of an outlet and leave when they want to.
 Different people see the world in their own way and in this projection the world is distorted and manipulated which can offer a variety of different experiences and perspectives. The sound is what snaps us back into reality while we experience the unnatural.
