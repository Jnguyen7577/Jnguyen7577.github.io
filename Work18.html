        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this installation I wanted to continue the idea of trauma and memories that do not escape oneâ€™s mind. With this piece I have created a surreal experience for the viewer, where the television heads are seen facing the center and a pathway that leads to larger TV heads. I wanted to create a world that is uncomfortable, where you are constantly being watched by several others of different sizes and no words are being spoken.
