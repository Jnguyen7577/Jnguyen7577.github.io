        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the original version of my glitch art, "Remember". In "Remember", there was repeition but for this piece I wanted it to give off a sense of feeling lost and not knowing where to go or what to expect. There was more thought and feeling put into this since this is how I felt at the time.</p>
